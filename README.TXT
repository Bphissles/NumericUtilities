### Utilities.java

The specifications for each method are provided in the javadoc comments.

Because this is a utility class
- It is non-extendable (finality "final")
- The constructor is hidden (visibility "private")
- All utility methods are accessible (visiblity "public")

### UtilitiesTest.java
This is a starting point for JUnit tests that check methods in Utilities.
It includes
- A constructor
- General test-fixture setup and teardown methods
- Sample unit test methods for at least one method in Utilities.
